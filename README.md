# Performance & Processing Notes


Phocyyyyy uses AI-powered server-side processing to perform color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement. This means the main processing happens on secure servers instead of your device, allowing better performance and more consistent results.

Processing time may vary depending on factors such as:

Media size and resolution

Video length

Network speed and stability

Current server load

Results are generated automatically by AI models and are displayed in the app once processing is completed. While most results are delivered quickly, some operations may take a few moments for larger files or videos.

An active internet connection is required for AI-based features to work properly.

Phocyyyyy is designed to balance speed and quality, providing efficient processing while maintaining the visual integrity of your images and videos.


# Privacy & Data Handling


Your privacy is important to us. Phocyyyyy processes your images and videos only to provide the requested AI-powered features such as color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement.

Selected media files are used strictly for temporary processing and are not permanently stored on our servers. Your images and videos are never used to train our AI models and are not shared with third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.

Processing is performed using secure, AI-powered server-side systems, and access to your data is limited only to what is necessary to complete the requested operations.

We may use trusted third-party services such as Google AdMob and Firebase Crashlytics for advertising, analytics, and app stability. These services may collect limited technical and device-related information in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they do not have access to your personal images or videos.

Phocyyyyy is designed to respect user privacy while delivering reliable and efficient AI-powered media processing.


# Limitations


Phocyyyyy uses automated AI models to perform color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement. While the app is designed to deliver reliable and high-quality results, the final output may vary depending on several factors.

Results may be affected by:

The quality, resolution, and lighting of the source and target media

The complexity of colors and scenes

Video length and file size

Network speed and stability during processing

AI-based processing does not guarantee perfect or identical results in every case. All results are generated automatically and are provided on an “as-is” basis.

Processing time may increase for large images or long videos, and performance may vary based on server load and internet connectivity.

These limitations are a normal part of AI-powered processing and do not indicate a fault in the application.


# Future Improvements


We are continuously working to enhance Phocyyyyy and improve the overall user experience. In future updates, we may introduce improvements such as:

Faster and more optimized AI processing

Better support for higher-resolution images and longer videos

Enhanced color transfer accuracy and consistency

Additional color style options and refinements

Performance and stability improvements

UI and usability enhancements based on user feedback

All future improvements will be focused on making color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement more efficient, reliable, and easy to use, while maintaining strong privacy and data protection standards.
